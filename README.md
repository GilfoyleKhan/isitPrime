This program is written in python.

Usually,we test prime number by mod(divide to get the remainder) the number by the previous number.
Example:
        5%2==1
        5%3==2
        5%4==1
If the result does not equal 0,then the number is prime.Hence,5 is prime.

This program can find prime number more efficiently by 
mod(divide to get the remainder) the number by the previous prime number.
Example:
        5%2==2
        5%3==3
5 doesn't need to mod by 4 because 4 is not prime number.

This technique can saves more time than mod the number by the previous number.

If this is not the best solution, 
you can fork it to improve my code using your favourite programming language
